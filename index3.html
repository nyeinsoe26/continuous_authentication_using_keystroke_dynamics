    “More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on <br />
    the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing. A lot of <br />
    them aren’t even pretending to be in charge,” Obama said during an online      <br />
    commencement address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities <br/>
    (HBCUs) on Saturday. <br />
    “Doing what feels good, what’s convenient, what’s easy - that’s how little kids <br />
    think,” he said in a second virtual speech on Saturday evening for graduating US <br />
    high school students. “Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some <br />
    with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way - which is why things are <br />
    so screwed up. <br />
    “I hope that instead, you decide to ground yourself in values that last, like honesty, <br />
    hard work, responsibility, fairness, generosity, respect for others.” <br />
